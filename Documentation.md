# Communication Method: Serial

This communication method is an interface for serial/COM ports. Serial ports are different from most other (read: modern) methods of communicating with computers. The main reason this is included is for use with small board computers like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, but may be useful for other, typically legacy, hardware. Users of legacy or uncommon hardware should beware that serial communication is finnicky even in the most favorable conditions, and this has only been tested thus far with modern equipment. An important note is that due to the limitations of the technology, only **one** instance of this communication method may exist per COM port. If you attempt to create a second instance for a serial port that already has an instance, the extension will simply return the existing instance. This functionality may be useful since you can regain a port's UUID if you lost it by attempting to create a new instance, but is more likely to be a source of headaches. The extension exposes a large number of low-level parameters through getters and setters in the hope that it will be useful to users with nonstandard or legacy hardware. If you're using modern "happy" hardware like an Arduino, or don't know what any of it means, there's a very good chance the defaults will work fine. The only parameters most users will need to touch are baud rate, whether writes are threaded, and when the extension sends data back to Arma. Threaded writes are off by default just because I haven't tested their stability thoroughly, but you should turn threaded writes on unless you have issues. Despite modern hardware being incredibly fast, serial communications defaults to the snail-like 9600 baud, and even at high baud rates the overhead of writes puts a lower bound of rougly **20ms for any write operation on my machine, even using emulated serial ports**. Of course threaded writes don't make that latency magically disappear, but they can shunt it off to one of the 3+ cores Arma never uses and let Arma get on with whatever stuff it needs to do in the meantime. Because Bohemia is working with a very old codebase that was absolutely not written with maintainability and performance in mind, Arma is single-threaded. SQF manages to fake the ability to run multiple scripts at once by using a basic scheduler that begins execution of a "thread", runs it until it passes some predefined allotment of time, and then moves on to the next "thread" if it isn't terribly behind and needs to yield its CPU time to other things. This tends to work well enough with how fast modern CPUs are, but a very important limitation is that the SQF VM **cannot make an extension yield its time**. When `callExtension` is run, Arma has to stop pretty much everything it's doing until the extension returns, which makes waiting around for a write to finish for 20+ms a very bad idea. If you're lucky enough for your game to be running at 60 FPS, that means a new frame comes through every 16.6ms - that's right, a single write to a serial port takes longer than running physics simulations and rendering an entire frame by almost 25%. So please, turn on threaded writes, and if that's not good enough, consider something other than the terribly dated technology that is serial communications.

## Static Commands

These commands must be called with the format `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["name of the communication method", ["command name", [arg1, arg2, ...]]`.
Those familiar with object-oriented programming should think of them as static methods on the communication method's class.

| Name | Arguments | Return Value | SQF Example | Comments |
| ---  | ---       | ---          | ---         | ---      |
| `create` | `portName`: `string` | A success or failure message | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["create", portName]];` | Creates an instance of this communication method and returns a UUID representing it. This command does not attempt to connect to the given port; the `connect` command must be called separately. Note that `portName` should be the name of the port (e.g. `COM1`), not its file (e.g. `\\.\\\\COM1`). |
| `listBaudRates` | None | A list of currently available baud rates in the format [[index:int , baudRate: int], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listBaudRates"]];` | This command simply enumerates the baud rates known to the extension; listed baud rates may not be compatible with the specific serial device. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
| `listDataBits` | None | A list of currently available data bits in the format [[index: int, dataBits: string], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listDataBits"]];` | This command simply enumerates the data bits known to the extension; listed data bits may not be compatible with the specific serial device. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
| `listInstances` | None | A list of instances of this communication method in the format [[UUID: string, portName: string], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listInstances"]];` | Lists extant instances of the serial communication method and their UUIDs so users have a hope of recovering their instance if they lose the UUID. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
| `listParities` | None | A list of currently available parities in the format [[index: int, parity: string], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listParities"]];` | This command simply enumerates the parities known to the extension; listed parities may not be compatible with the specific serial device. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
| `listPorts` | None | A list of currently available COM (serial) ports in the format [[portName: string, portDriver: string], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listPorts"]];` | Queries the currently available DOS COM ports using the Windows function `QueryDosDevice` from COM0 to COM254 inclusive. This method is marginally more computationally expensive than checking the registry, but the registry may be out of date, so this command is guaranteed to return the most up-to-date data. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
| `listStopBits` | None | A list of currently available stop bits in the format [[index: int, stopBits: string], ...] | `"ArmaCOM" callExtension ["Serial", ["listStopBits"]];` | This command simply enumerates the stop bits known to the extension; listed stop bits may not be compatible with the specific serial device. Remember to use `parseSimpleArray` since extensions can only communicate using strings. |
## Instance Commands

These commands must be called with the format `"ArmaCOM" callExtension [myInstanceUUID, ["command name", [arg1, arg2, ...]]`.
Those familiar with object-oriented programming should think of them as instance methods on your instance of the communication method's class.
